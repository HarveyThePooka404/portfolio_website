                <p>For a school project, we were commissionned by Kopenhagen to offer a new design for their website.
                    Kopenhagen.dk used to be one of the major art calendar for Copenhagen and its surroundings. I
                    offered a sober tone, luxury-feel design to the new design.</p>

                <p>.Série is a young brand, starting in Copenhagen. Sarah Martet, its founder, is looking to create
                    hand-made, made-to-order leather accessories. I have worked with her intensively, both on her brand
                    and upcoming website. As part of the second semester exam at KEA, we were to create a website
                    working with a local craftman.</p>

                <p>One of our school projects was to create a student data for Hogwarts. While not being perfect, it's a
                    project that I am proud of. I think it reflected my actual experience from HR software, and I was
                    able to have my own user experience guiding the design.</p>

                </a>
                <p>One of my first personal projects, I wanted to create something simple and fun. Part of the reasons
                    that I went into web-design was to solve this kind of small puzzles: can I do it? how would I do it?
                    It is just a quick Drumbeat, made with japanese drums. You can both click and use directional
                    arrows.
