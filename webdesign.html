                    Kopenhagen.dk used to be one of the major art calendar for Copenhagen and its surroundings. I
                    offered a sober tone, luxury-feel design to the new design.</p>

                    and upcoming website. As part of the second semester exam at KEA, we were to create a website
                    working with a local craftman.</p>

                    project that I am proud of. I think it reflected my actual experience from HR software, and I was
                    able to have my own user experience guiding the design.</p>

                    choice. I decided to create a small preview page for all of the Array methods offered by lodash. It
                    shows directly what would happen to an array, and uses lodash in its script.

                <p>One of my first personal projects, I wanted to create something simple and fun. Part of the reasons
                    that I went into web-design was to solve this kind of small puzzles: can I do it? how would I do it?
                    It is just a quick Drumbeat, made with japanese drums. You can both click and use directional
                    arrows.
