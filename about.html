            <h2>Oh hi there !</h2>
            <p>Here is some more about me as a person, rather than a coworker. If you want to learn more
                about my career, you should check-out my <a href="resume.html" class="intext-a">resume</a> or maybe my
                <a href="portfolio.html" class="intext-a">portfolio</a>.
            </p>

            <p> What is my design philosophy? Well, most of my philosophy is based on ... philosophy. While studying it
                in high-school, I fell in love with the field. Starting with Spinoza, the idea of process and continuity
                became very important to me. Then I read Whitehead, and Process and Philosophy, and everything became
                clear to me. We should think of everything as not a difference of nature, but a difference of degree.

            </p>

            <p> How does it apply to my design? You can easily apply that principle to Web-design actually. There is not
                a difference of nature between mobile and desktop, so there shouldn't be one in your design. It most
                generally works
                in coding: think of your CSS-classes as an extension of a base-design, not a difference.
            </p>

            <p>Is that who I am? Yes, I can talk about theories, philosophy and design all day long. I love concepts.
                But I also love to do so around a good meal (and I am passionate about cooking). See how it works: I
                love discussing things. It's my core. Then around this, there is the hospitality extension. I love to
                host. But I also need to keep in shape, so I practice climbing and MMA when there isn't a global
                pandemic.</p>

            <p>So next time you are stuck on a problem, think about it: what is it an extension from?</p>
